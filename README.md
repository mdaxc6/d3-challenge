# Custom Visualization with D3
An custom, interactive visual based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau.
Created using the D3 JavaScript library.

Currently the webpage is not hosted, so the easiest way to view is to clone the repo and open index.html using the Live Server plugin for Visual Studio Code.
